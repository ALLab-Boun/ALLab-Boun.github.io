description: Undergraduate Student
bio: I’m an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at Boğaziçi University. My research focuses on understanding Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Dementia by building predictive models that track patient health over time using longitudinal data. I’m especially interested in how machine learning, deep learning, and time-series modeling can be applied to real-world problems in biomedical informatics. Outside of research, I love playing the piano and listening to classical music.
