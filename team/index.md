      I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Michigan State University. 
      I was a research assistant in the <a href="http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pattern Recognition and Image Processing Lab</a> under the supervision of 
      <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/~jain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anil Jain</a> and
