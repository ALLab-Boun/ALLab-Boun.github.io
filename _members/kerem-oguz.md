description: Undergraduate Student
bio: I’m an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Engineering at Boğaziçi University. My research focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly working with data from patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). I explore sequential models and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to better understand patterns in medical data. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball and sailing.
